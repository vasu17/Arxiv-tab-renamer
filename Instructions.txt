HOW TO INSTALL ARXIV TITLE FIXER
====================================================

This extension is built for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.).
Since it is installed manually, please follow these steps:

STEP 1: PREPARE THE FILES
----------------------------------------------------
1. Download the "extension.zip" file from the Releases page.
2. Unzip (extract) the file into a folder on your computer.
   * IMPORTANT: You cannot load the file while it is still zipped. 
   * You must right-click and select "Extract All..." or "Unzip".

STEP 2: OPEN THE EXTENSIONS MENU
----------------------------------------------------
Open your browser and navigate to the extensions management page:

* Google Chrome:  Type "chrome://extensions" in the address bar.
* Microsoft Edge: Type "edge://extensions" in the address bar.
* Brave Browser:  Type "brave://extensions" in the address bar.
* Opera:          Type "opera://extensions" in the address bar.

STEP 3: ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE
----------------------------------------------------
1. Look for a toggle switch named "Developer mode".
   * Chrome/Brave: Top-right corner.
   * Edge: Left sidebar or bottom-left corner.
2. Turn this switch ON. 
   (You should see new buttons appear, like "Load unpacked").

STEP 4: INSTALL THE EXTENSION
----------------------------------------------------
1. Click the button labeled "Load unpacked".
2. A file selection window will open. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the extension in Step 1.
3. Select the folder and click "Select Folder" (or "Open").

Done! The extension should now appear in your list and is ready to use.

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------------------
* Error: "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"
  Solution: You likely selected the wrong folder level or didn't unzip the file. 
  Make sure you select the folder that directly contains the "manifest.json" file.

* Error: "Could not load background script"
  Solution: Delete the extension from the list and try adding it again. Ensure all files (background.js, content.js) are present in the folder.
